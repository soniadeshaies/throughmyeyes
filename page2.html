    <h1 class="title">OVERTHINKING</h1>
    <p id="one">i miss being a ghost of the city
        alone and complete
        where the winds kiss burns me
        and i never feel so alive 
    </p>
    <p id="two">
        sometimes, in a busy cafe, i sit and think solely of you
        my eyes misty with memories, i wonder what it would be like if you never left
        i fantasize over a life i will never get to have and i dream of a person i will never get to be
        it’s a funny thing, wanting only what u don’t have
        but i seem to always be absorbed in the experiences that were never mine
        in the relationships i never had
        and the people i never met
        maybe it’s all better that this happened 
        and maybe if you stayed, you’d be dreaming of the life u would have if only you left 
        but it doesn’t matter anymore because life has moved on 
        and i guess it’s time i finally do to
    </p>
    <p id="three">
        a semester of memories all to myself
        the ghost of the city i flout around alone
        alone because it’s easier
        alone because it’s fun
        but mostly alone because i don’t want to connect memories of people to a places anymore
        i am haunted in my room by the feelings of what once was
        i try my best to find solace in the city
        but there’s too many places that’ll never feel the same because I was there with YOU
        and now i’m there alone
        theres very little places that feel like they’re just mine
        and im scared that if i go somewhere with someone 
        ill lose all that i have left
    </p>
    <p id="four">
        wind brushing the hair across my face is the most divine feeling of being
        the awareness of my body in any given moment
        to feel what’s around me and real 
        and to not question it 
        the wind’s hug is a harsh one
        and the cold air is a poor comfort
        but it’s nice to finally feel something again,
        something more than your absence          
    </p>
    <p id="five">
        Alone and lonely
        This large house consumes me 
        Days are endless voids of time 
        Im tried of feeling empty
        I want to be held
        I miss your hair
        I want to go home
        I miss me
    </p>
    <p id="six">
        i see your eyes in the trees
        fiery and intricate
        i collect leaves to try and build your person
        but my hands are clumsy and your form is beyond anything physical
        i want to tell you how much i miss you but i can’t quite piece together the words that capture my feelings
        the distance erodes my brain 
        so i watch the trees for hours 
        and i memorize how the leaves flutter
        because i hope it somehow brings me closer to you
